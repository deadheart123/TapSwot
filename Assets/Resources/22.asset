  cardTitle: 'Rethinking measures '
  cardDescription: 'Transport measures could have new consequences in a triple access
    world '
  cardBrief: "Transport measures within mobility planning have been seen as transport
    solutions addressing a transport problem. Problems more fundamentally relate
    to access, and in this respect a triple access lens can increasingly be used
    to think through the possible consequences of transport measures as part of an
    urban mobility plan \u2013 e.g. road pricing is not just about the choice between
    car and public transport but may influence the role of spatial proximity and
    digital connectivity.  "
