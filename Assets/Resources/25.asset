  cardDescription: 'Limited understanding of triple access dynamics produces difference
    of opinion '
  cardBrief: 'The nature and use of the Triple Access System continues to change
    and be changed. Research efforts reveal how challenging it is to make sense of
    the System and how its elements interact. As a result, while the new approach
    invites an opening of minds to thinking more broadly than only about motorised
    transport, it may not be possible to achieve a strong shared level of confidence
    in a particular interpretation of the System.  '
