  cardTitle: 'Silo mentality '
  cardDescription: 'Joined-up government can often remain elusive making triple access
    problematic '
  cardBrief: 'Efforts in the past to more strongly embrace access-based planning
    have proved challenging due to differing perspectives and understandings and
    the difficulty of bringing these together across different jurisdictions of responsibility.
    It is rare for mobility, spatial and digital planning to be treated as a combined
    function. Existing organisational structures may work against being able to fulfil
    such a function.  '
