  cardTitle: "Preparing for\vthe worst "
  cardDescription: "If the need for major change intensifies, forecast-led planning
    won\u2019t do "
  cardBrief: "It is hard to judge different forms of planning or even their outcomes
    as right or wrong. Weaker planning that \u2018goes with the flow\u2019 of external
    forces may seem sufficient. However, in the face of climate change and shifting
    attitudes and behaviours, the demand for stronger planning that can respond to
    this may grow. Planning authorities that are engaging with, and growing their
    proficiency in, the new approach stand to be better placed to respond.  "
