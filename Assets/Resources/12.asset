  cardTitle: 'Encourages diversity of perspective '
  cardDescription: 'Actively thinking beyond the transport system brings new insight
    and prospects '
  cardBrief: 'The system (or system of systems) of transport and society is a complex
    one in relation to supply and demand. Mobility planning with only a transport
    mindset constraints the ability to make sense of the system that planning seeks
    to shape. A planning approach that considers triple access naturally lends itself
    to bringing transport, spatial and digital planners and other experts together.
    Their shared mental model of the present and future can strengthen planning.  '
