  cardTitle: "Lack of public\vbuy-in "
  cardDescription: 'Many people see themselves as locked-in to car dependent lifestyles '
  cardBrief: "Triple Access Planning seeks to better equip society for a sustainable
    prosperous future by \u2018putting the private car in its place\u2019 in a wide
    repertoire of forms of access. While this may be the case, the sort of mobility
    planning it produces may provoke strong resistance from parts of the public who
    see the way ahead as incompatible with their present-day means of access fulfilment. "
