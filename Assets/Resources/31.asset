  cardTitle: 'Other access influencers '
  cardDescription: 'There are multiple influencers of access and this complicates
    shaping the future '
  cardBrief: 'With recognition of the triple access nature of transport comes a realisation
    of how many different players are involved in shaping the forms of access available
    in society. The way employment, shopping and other services are organised in
    space and time and their functional form all affect access. Digital and transport
    service providers in the private and public sectors are at play. This makes it
    challenging to co-ordinate understanding of access in the present and shaping
    of it in the future.  '
