  cardTitle: 'Lack of precedents '
  cardDescription: 'Planning authorities taking a lead with a new approach can feel
    exposed '
  cardBrief: 'While conventional urban mobility planning may not be perfect or may
    even fall short, there is strength in numbers, strength in conforming with norms
    of practice and norms of professional, public, political expectation. In contrast,
    embracing triple access with vision-led appetite, and addressing uncertainty
    is more novel. The reassurance of others having already tried and tested the
    approach to good effect is in short supply.  '
