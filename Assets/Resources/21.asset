  cardTitle: 'Too abstract and intangible '
  cardDescription: 'The new approach is conceptually appealing but hard to apply '
  cardBrief: "Triple Access Planning points to the triple access reality of our lives
    and in this respect can be conceptually very appealing. However, moving from
    the abstract to the specifics of how to observe, understand and influence triple
    access demands more than a new philosophy. It can well demand tools and processes,
    and detailed guidance for their use. The new approach does not \u2018hand hold\u2019
    practitioners through its application.  "
