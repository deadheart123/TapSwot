  cardTitle: Future proof
  cardDescription: 'Realising a vision involves being able to accommodate uncertainty '
  cardBrief: "Exposing uncertainty about the future involves developing different
    possible future contexts \u2013 explorative scenarios -  to which a plan\u2019s
    implementation may be exposed. Scenario planning allows the plan itself to be
    devised in a way that its creators can ask \u201Cis this part of the plan going
    to work regardless of what the future has to throw at us?\u201D. A policy or
    measure that in any scenario helps progress towards a vision for a better future
    is more robust or \u2018future proof\u2019. "
