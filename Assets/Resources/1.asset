  cardTitle: 'Hard to model '
  cardDescription: 'Representing a more complex system is too resource and time hungry '
  cardBrief: "Representing supply and demand for physical mobility, spatial proximity
    and digital connectivity would need further model development, and data may not
    exist to support this. To then model multiple \u2018what-if\u2019 futures would
    need more resources and time that could slow the planning process.  "
