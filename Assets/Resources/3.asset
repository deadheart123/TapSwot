  cardTitle: Hard to understand
  cardDescription: 'If the concepts are new they may be harder to understand and
    buy into '
  cardBrief: 'Planners are familiar with urban mobility planning that is forecast-led
    and transport-focused. They have a confidence in practicing this approach. A
    new approach requires new understanding which can make it harder to believe in
    and in turn invest effort in. '
