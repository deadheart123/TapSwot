  cardTitle: 'Acts as a complement '
  cardDescription: 'The new approach can enhance existing mobility planning '
  cardBrief: 'Triple Access Planning and its handling of uncertainty are not a wholesale
    substitute for conventional mobility planning. The new approach encourages a
    rethinking and broadening of planning perspective and promotes the need to stress-test
    a plan against uncertainty. This helps reframe the mobility planning process
    at its outset and adds new means of engaging in and applying that process.  '
