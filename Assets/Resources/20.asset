  cardTitle: 'Access at the core '
  cardDescription: 'Society thrives on access, with mobility being only one means
    to that end '
  cardBrief: 'The functioning of society and the wellbeing of individuals relies
    upon being able to access people, employment, goods, services and opportunities.
    Motorised mobility is not synonymous with access. It is a means to an end. Spatial
    proximity and especially digital connectivity represent other important (complementary)
    means to that end. Triple Access Planning helps ensure all means are drawn upon
    to help achieve the end in the most appropriate way.  '
