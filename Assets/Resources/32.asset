  cardTitle: 'Considers the art of the possible '
  cardDescription: 'Being encouraged to imagine future change strengthens planning '
  cardBrief: 'Consider how much change has happened in the last 20 years to access.
    Consider how, where and when you work and play and engage with others. The future
    is not just more or less of what we have now. The form and qualities of activities
    and their access is likely to change, perhaps quite substantially. A planning
    approach that actively encourages exploration of what change might unfold helps
    better determine how to account for and shape such change.  '
