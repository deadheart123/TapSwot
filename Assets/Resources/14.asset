  cardDescription: 'There is growing recognition of a need to move away from business
    as usual '
  cardBrief: "The adage \u2018if you do what you\u2019ve always done you will get
    what you\u2019ve always got\u2019 is pertinent to mobility planning. Whether
    as professionals, politicians or as members of the public, there is a wish (albeit
    not universal) to work with the dynamics of our times to shape a different type
    of future society that supports diversity and prospers while living within its
    means and environmental boundaries. A new approach to planning helps free up
    our minds to embrace new possibilities.  "
