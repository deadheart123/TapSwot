  cardTitle: 'Necessity is the mother of invention '
  cardDescription: 'Uncertainty and a climate emergency invite new, bolder ways forward '
  cardBrief: 'Uncertainty becomes an opportunity in the sense that if the future
    cannot be predicted then we are offered greater invitation to shape it. The climate
    emergency demands that it is shaped in pursuit of a vision that is different
    to business as usual and which involves a makeup of access that treads more lightly
    on the planet. The proactive and participatory nature of the approach lends itself
    strongly to enabling and helping to justify bolder ways forwards.  '
