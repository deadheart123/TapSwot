  cardTitle: 'A need to quantify '
  cardDescription: 'Analytical rigour often means numbers, and precise numbers at
    that '
  cardBrief: "The adage \u2018if you can\u2019t count it, it doesn\u2019t count\u2019
    reminds us that what matters may lie beyond what (big) data and numbers are able
    to convincingly represent. The concept of \u2018access\u2019 has struggled to
    be embraced in mobility planning because a unifying definition and means of measuring
    has proved elusive. Definitions and numbers can only go so far in helping us
    in a meaningful way in planning for the future. Nevertheless if a new approach
    cannot play the numbers game\u2026  "
