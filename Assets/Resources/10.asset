  cardTitle: 'Accommodating uncertainty '
  cardDescription: 'Society is in a state of flux with a heightened need to plan
    for uncertainty '
  cardBrief: "Once upon a time it may have seemed that \u2018more of the same\u2019
    car-dependent planning would suffice in a world where road traffic and economic
    output seemed to be tightly coupled. Now the world is changing. Decarbonisation
    demands something different. The digital age may well further transform how we
    live our lives, but in ways that can be hard to imagine. Being able to explore
    and account for different possible triple access futures is preferable to (only)
    forecasting traffic.  "
