  cardTitle: 'Encourages ambition '
  cardDescription: 'Stronger planning can result from inviting us to dream '
  cardBrief: "While conventional mobility planning does not prohibit \u2018thinking
    big\u2019, it can tend towards conservatism and preserving the established form
    and function of mobility. The new approach more explicitly invites us to explore
    new possibilities both in terms of what could change and what could be encouraged
    to change. By better engaging with understanding how the world is changing, could
    change and needs to change, ambitious vision-led planning is possible. "
