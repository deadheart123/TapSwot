  cardTitle: 'New skills required '
  cardDescription: 'This planning approach calls for new capabilities and competencies '
  cardBrief: "Not only does this new planning approach encourage a fresh philosophical
    perspective on how and why we plan and how we might plan differently, it also
    demands new skills and processes \u2013 and related capabilities and competencies.
    Being able to co-create a shared triple-access vision, being able to constructively
    explore uncertainty, and being able to guide more robust decision making are
    challenging prospects for those unfamiliar with them.   "
