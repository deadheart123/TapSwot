  cardTitle: 'Lack of headspace '
  cardDescription: 'Planning authorities may lack capacity and resources for planning
    differently '
  cardBrief: 'Many transport authorities are resource constrained and facing short-term
    pressures and demands that have been exacerbated significantly by the COVID-19
    pandemic. This can make it difficult to prioritise strategic planning for the
    longer-term. While expectation for onward mobility planning and its delivery
    will exist, this can already be intellectually and procedurally challenging.
    Accordingly, it may be difficult to find the capacity and resources to engage
    in a new approach.  '
