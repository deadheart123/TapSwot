  cardTitle: 'Lack of evidence '
  cardDescription: 'How different forms of access are at work is poorly understood  '
  cardBrief: 'While evidence on the transport system and its use is integral to transport
    planning, the picture is less clear in relation to the land-use system and even
    more so in terms of the telecommunications system and its use. The three systems
    and how they are used are interconnected and changing (at different rates). Making
    sense empirically of the Triple Access System is challenging (albeit that the
    TAS exists and affects transport whether sense is made of it or not).  '
