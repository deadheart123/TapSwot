  cardDescription: Triple access offers the prospect of less motorised mobility and
    emissions
  cardBrief: Alongside economic prosperity and social wellbeing is environmental
    sustainability and the imperative to urgently address climate change. Giving
    greater emphasis to spatial proximity and digital connectivity in urban mobility
    planning can help reduce dependence upon motorised mobility and especially the
    private car, leading to reduced carbon dioxide emissions while still allowing
    people to lead their lives socially and economically.
