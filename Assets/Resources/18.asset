  cardTitle: 'Responsible planning '
  cardDescription: 'Strong planning is needed that is more than only accountable
    to due process '
  cardBrief: 'While established planning process and appraisal offer a framework
    for addressing future mobility, it is no longer sufficient to have demonstrated
    accountability in following due process. There is a need for planning that helps
    decision makers to take greater responsibility for charting a course ahead that
    holds the prospect of achieving meaningful change to help address environmental
    and social as well as economic concerns. The approach offered more proactively
    facilitates this.  '
