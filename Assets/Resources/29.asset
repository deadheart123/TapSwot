  cardTitle: 'Dependence on more actors '
  cardDescription: 'A greater pool of expertise is needed to capitalise upon what
    the approach offers '
  cardBrief: 'Conventional mobility planning has been centred upon the transport
    system with mixed experience of engagement with spatial planning. Even more remote
    has been any engagement with evolving expertise in digital planning. Added to
    this is a need for expertise in foresight methods to explore possible futures
    and how they may be reached. This all points to a need for a greater range of
    expertise to be involved in the planning process which is harder to find and
    harness.  '
