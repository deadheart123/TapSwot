  cardTitle: 'Professional resistance to change '
  cardDescription: 'Those invested in established approaches may be uncomfortable '
  cardBrief: 'Sense of purpose, reputation and security come from achieving a level
    of proficiency in the application of particular tools, methods and processes.
    Understandably individuals and organisations have invested in such proficiency
    associated with established approaches. They may be instinctively reluctant to
    embrace a new approach that is seen to diminish their return on the investment
    in skills and experience that they have made. '
