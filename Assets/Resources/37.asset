  cardTitle: "It doesn\u2019t guarantee better outcomes "
  cardDescription: 'What is a better future is subjective and in the hands of those
    involved '
  cardBrief: 'Within conventional mobility planning it is possible to progress towards
    a future that for some is desirable. The new approach is intended to offer a
    process that is more overtly vision-led and broader in outlook through its triple-access
    view. However, the actors involved in the process are what determines the plan
    that results. They bring their own values, vested interests and preconceptions.
    Be careful what you wish for.   '
