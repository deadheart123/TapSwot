  cardTitle: "It doesn\u2019t compute"
  cardDescription: 'Getting people to buy-in to the new approach is not guaranteed '
  cardBrief: "Whether as decision makers, planners or analysts, not everyone sees
    the need for a new approach. They may not be convinced that uncertainty about
    the future is that great. They may have strong faith in a transport-centric approach
    to mobility planning and believe the existing processes and tools are sufficient.
    The new approach is predicated on people\u2019s buy-in to engaging with it and
    seeing a need to innovate.  "
