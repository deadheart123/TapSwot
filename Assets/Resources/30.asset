  cardTitle: 'The need for adaptive capacity '
  cardDescription: 'In the face of system shocks society needs to be adaptive and
    resilient '
  cardBrief: 'COVID-19 highlighted our collective reliance upon the Triple Access
    System as a source of resilience within which businesses and individuals could
    adapt their behaviours. Resilience and adaptive capacity would seem of growing
    importance. A planning process that is able to actively improve examination of,
    and changes to, a system comprised of multiple forms of access should be of great
    appeal.  '
