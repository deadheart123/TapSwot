  cardTitle: 'Conceptually appealing '
  cardDescription: 'The new approach resonates with what professionals feel they
    need '
  cardBrief: 'Many planning professionals would recognise the merit of being vision-led
    rather than forecast-led, of looking beyond road traffic, and of confronting
    uncertainty. The portrayal of the Triple Access System within which transport
    finds its place and role in access is simple and compelling. As such the new
    approach is conceptually appealing which encourages challenge to conventional
    mobility planning. '
