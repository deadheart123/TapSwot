  cardTitle: 'Helps us to unthink '
  cardDescription: 'By stepping back and helping open our minds new perspectives
    can emerge '
  cardBrief: 'It is easy for conventional thinking in transport planning and analysis
    to blinker how we perceive the present and how best to take steps to shape the
    future. By developing new mental models of the present and future of our triple
    access world it becomes possible to question prior assumptions. It becomes possible
    to unthink and then rethink the scope of urban mobility planning and reimagine
    what steps could be taken on a pathway ahead.  '
