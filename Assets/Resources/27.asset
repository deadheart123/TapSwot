  cardTitle: Lack of appraisal framework
  cardDescription: 'The planning system continues to expect conformity with approved
    approaches '
  cardBrief: 'The new approach may be, or be perceived to be, acting outside of the
    bounds of recognised appraisal practice. By not being able to demonstrate conformity
    or to effectively offer a convincing alternative appraisal framework, Triple
    Access Planning, including its treatment of uncertainty, may fail to garner support
    and endorsement. Without this sense of legitimacy, putting it into practice could
    be jeopardised.  '
