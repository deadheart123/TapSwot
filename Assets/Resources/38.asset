  cardTitle: 'Moving beyond white male privilege '
  cardDescription: 'In order to better account for a diverse population we must think
    differently '
  cardBrief: 'The transport system has predominantly been designed by men; in many
    countries by white, men. Gender, ethnicity and other protected characteristics
    that reflect the true and diverse makeup of the society that transport and access
    support have been largely overlooked. Thankfully, this is changing and needs
    to change. A planning approach that is less rooted in the past and more concerned
    with engaging diverse voices in the present about preferable futures is key.  '
