  cardDescription: 'Stakes are high for politicians in the face of change and they
    need legitimacy '
  cardBrief: 'Decision making on policies and investments that shape the future is
    seldom easy for the politicians involved. They are unlikely to welcome any suggestion
    of uncertainty bringing into question their judgement. They may wish to assert
    confidence in more conventional thinking and a belief that primacy of motorised
    mobility will endure. Conversely a vision-led approach in which uncertainty abounds
    could be mis-used in service of vested interests. '
