  cardTitle: 'Cognitive overload '
  cardDescription: 'The complexity of present and future triple access is too hard
    to process '
  cardBrief: 'There are many, many factors at play in making sense of the present
    day Triple Access System and its use in a diverse society. The complexity is
    compounded by the challenge of contemplating how and to what extent such factors
    are important in influencing the future. Being able to process this and draw
    planning conclusions from it with confidence can be highly demanding if not unmanageable.  '
