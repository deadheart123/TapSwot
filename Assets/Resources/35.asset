  cardTitle: "Damned by\vfaint praise "
  cardDescription: "A new approach that doesn\u2019t fit someone\u2019s agenda is
    unwelcome "
  cardBrief: 'Stronger planning suggests shaping a more inclusive, fair, environmentally
    sensitive and prosperous future. This may not fit the narrative of beneficiaries
    of a present system that serves them well. As a result they may either seek to
    exert disproportionate influence on a new and participative approach, or they
    may subtly cast doubt on the credibility of the approach, anxious to preserve
    the more familiar orthodox approach to planning where their influence is established.  '
